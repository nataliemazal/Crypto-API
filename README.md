# Crypto-API
This project is a Single Page Application foundation about crypto currencies. In order to the provide useful information, I used three different external API's which let the users access to relevant information of more than 5,000 currencies.

In this project, I had to demonstrate knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using new HTML5 tags, CSS3 media queries and advanced selectors, as well as Dynamic page layouts, Bootstrap and Flex. In JavaScript, I used Objects, jQuery, Events, Ajax, Async await and more.
